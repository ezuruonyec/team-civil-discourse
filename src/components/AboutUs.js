                    The Padnos/Sarosik Civil Discourse Program was founded through the generous gift of Shelley E. Padnos and Carol Sarosik to help create “more inclusive, tolerant, and peaceful communities."(GVSU 2020).
                    Current Padnos/Sarosik Endowed Professor of Civil Discourse Jeff Kelly Lowenstein noticed that there was no global map ranking the level of civil discourse by country.
                    He thought that building such a map could help make the subject more accessible to people who did not have prior knowledge in this area and provide a standard for meaningful dialogue.
                    With the help of students from GVSU, this map seeks to communicate the implications for civil discourse of the tension between those people working to share accurate information and those individuals, organizations and governments seeking to misinform and disinform the public.
                    We hope this tool will play a positive role in helping people engage in civil discourse and have thought-provoking conversations.

                <p style = {{ fontFamily: "Verdana", textAlign: 'justify'}}>
                    We went through an extensive process in the fall of 2020 to identify the variables we used for each country’s civil discourse rating.
                    We sought to find variables that would illustrate the intersection between national commitments to freedom of speech and media with the reality residents experience in the areas of press freedom, internet access and online censorship.
                </p>
                <p style = {{ fontFamily: "Verdana", textAlign: 'justify'}}>
                    Our initial steps involved researching and recording each country’s national and
                    international promises to freedom of speech and media.  For the international level this
                    consisted of seeing which countries that belonged to the United Nations had supported the
                    <a href="https://www.un.org/en/member-states/"> 2000 Millennium Declaration.</a> The declaration reaffirmed the
                    <a href="https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/"> 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> that included freedom of speech and media.
                </p>
                <p style = {{ fontFamily: "Verdana", textAlign: 'justify'}}>
                    We also looked into nations’ <a href="https://rsf.org/en/ranking">Reporters Without Borders 2020 World Press Freedom Index </a>ranking, <a href="https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/idb/region.php">population, </a><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS">internet access, </a>
                    <a href="https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/online-censorship-country-rank/"> and online censorship, </a>
                    For each of these variables we sought to find a database that would include as many countries as possible.  We also explored whether countries had passed fake news laws, but did not find a single database that contained a comprehensive listing of these measures.
                </p>
                <p style = {{ fontFamily: "Verdana", textAlign: 'justify'}}>
                    Eventually, we decided to include the Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index, the level of internet access, the online censorship level and whether the country signed the Millennium Declaration.  After discussing the relative weight each variable should receive, we decided that that the press freedom index should be 37.5% of the score, the internet access should be 30% of the score, the online censorship should be 22.5% of the score, and the Millennium Declaration signature should be 10% of the score.  Since each of the variables used different scales, we based our calculation on the country’s ranking on that variable relative to other countries. We included the country’s population in its individual profile, but did not include them in the final calculation.
                </p>
                <p style = {{ fontFamily: "Verdana", textAlign: 'justify'}}>
                We continued to refine the civil discourse ranking in the fall of 2021, adding countries’ literacy rates into the variable.  After much discussion we decided that the press freedom index should be 35% of the score, internet access should be 32.5% of the score, online censorship should be 20% of the score, literacy rate should be 7.5% of the score, and the Millennium Declaration signature should be 5% of the score.

                With the support of a Teaching Innovation Grant from the  Pew Faculty Teaching and Learning Center (FTLC) at Grand Valley, we collaborated with French, Spanish, and Multimedia Journalism faculty and students to record, translate, and edit interviews with French- and Spanish-speaking journalists about their experiences with misinformation and their strategies to combat it.  These interviews are embedded on the profiles for the following countries: Benin, Cameroon, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, France, Mali, Peru, and Senegal.

                    This project began in the summer of 2020, when Padnos/Sarosik Intern Samantha Johnson and Lanthorn Editor-In-Chief Nicholas Moran looking up and entering information about each country’s national and international promises of press and media freedoms.

                    The IDS 350 class taught by Professor Kelly Lowenstein contributed all of the information used in the Civil Discourse Map. We would like to recognize each student in the class, the seven computer science students who worked on the web application, and Computer Science Professor Jonathan Englesma.
